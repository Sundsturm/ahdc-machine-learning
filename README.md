# Arrhythmia Holter Detection and Classification (AHDC)
AHDC is a specialized feature of an EKG Holter that detects and classifies various type of arrhythmias using a pretrained machine learning model. This repository is intended for the training of the machine learning model. Also, this repository uses datalumina's project template (https://github.com/datalumina/datalumina-project-template).

This project uses TensorFlow by WSL2 with Ubuntu as its distro. See https://www.tensorflow.org/install for more details.
